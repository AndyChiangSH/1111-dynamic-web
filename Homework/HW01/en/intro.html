                <p>The information technology industry is one of the most important industries in our country. As the information department of the only top university in central my country, the department should take the training of national top information industry talents as its mission. In order to cultivate all-round information talents with information theory, hardware, software, network multimedia and information applications, the curriculum planning of this department focuses on the following five areas: <span style="font-weight:bold; color:red;">network multimedia, embedded systems, intelligent systems, Internet of Things and Cloud computing and information security</span>, and have the following school-running characteristics:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The curriculum planning emphasizes both theoretical and practical courses. For example, "Logic Design", "Operation System" and "Electronic Circuits" are combined to offer "Logic Design Experiment", "Operation System Experiment" and "Electronic Circuit Experiment"; "Information Topics" is listed as a compulsory course in order to cultivate information talents with theoretical foundation and practical ability.</li>
                    <li>Training students' programming ability: First of all, the basic programming course of the department is divided into two semesters: the first semester is "computer programming", the next semester is "object-oriented programming", and students are trained in basic programming in one academic year. Second, each teacher will arrange programming-related homework in the course to strengthen students’ programming ability; in addition, the department also offers multiple programming courses in the sophomore, junior, and senior years, such as combination language and system programming , Windows environment programming, Unix system and Script programming, network programming, smart phone application development, etc. The Department also encourages students to participate in relevant programming competitions, University Programming Proficiency Test (CPE), etc. to further enhance their programming skills. The department also invited Professor Wu Yonghui from Shanghai Fudan University to come to the department during the winter and summer vacations to train students' programming skills.</li>
                    <li>In response to the trend of the cloud industry, the Department and the Department of Applied Mathematics jointly set up the "Cloud Computing and Service Course" in the Institute, so that the Department can start to cultivate talents in cloud computing and massive data analysis since 2011, and participate in the national training program. Sex contest, won many awards, and achieved remarkable results.</li>
                    <li>The department requires faculty to combine teaching subjects with areas of personal academic research and practical experience. Therefore, in the course delivery, the relevant courses are offered according to the expertise of the teachers. At the same time, teachers will also apply their latest knowledge and achievements in research results and practical experience to teaching, so as to enhance the fun and effect of students' learning.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The planning and design of the courses of this department are based on the implementation of students' core competencies, and adhere to the spirit of "theory and application", and "depth and breadth" complement each other, in order to lay students' theoretical foundation and practical ability in the field of information, and then improve and To expand the depth and breadth of students in information technology, and ultimately to promote the development of information-related industries in the central region and the country.</p>
                <p>Promoting the "knowledge economy" has become an important direction for future economic development, and high-quality information talents are an indispensable part of the knowledge economy. As the information department of the only top university in central China, the department is dedicated to cultivating the nation's top information industry talents. Based on this concept, the Department has set the following educational goals, and based on the educational goals and different academic systems, the core competencies that students should possess:</p>
